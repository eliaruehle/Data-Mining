Metrics for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---> Could be useful for evaluating Decision Tree: Gini coefficient: Single value representing the measure of inequality in a distribution; commonly used in economics.
Shannon Diversity Index: Single value representing the measure of the diversity or richness of a dataset.
Root Mean Square (RMS): Single value representing the square root of the mean of the squares of a set of values; provides a measure of the overall magnitude.
Persistence: Single value representing the measure of how long a value persists before changing significantly.
Hurst Rescaled Range: Single value representing the measure of long-term memory or self-similarity in a time series.
Anomaly Score: Single value representing the measure of how anomalous or unusual a data point is compared to the rest of the dataset.
Cross-validation Score: Single value representing the performance score obtained by applying cross-validation techniques to evaluate a model.
Residual Sum of Squares (RSS): Single value representing the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values in a regression model.
