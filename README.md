# How to Work with Poetry

## Introduction

Poetry is a package manager for Python that aims to provide an easy-to-use and efficient way of managing Python projects and their dependencies. In this guide, we will cover the basic steps of working with Poetry to create and manage Python projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you can work with Poetry, you need to have it installed on your system. You can install it via pip:

```
$ pip install poetry
```

## Adding Dependencies

To add a dependency to your project, you can use the `add` command. This will add the specified package to your project's dependencies and update your `pyproject.toml` file:

```
$ poetry add package-name
```

You can also specify a specific version of the package by appending `@version` to the package name.

## Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies for your project, you can use the `install` command:

```
$ poetry install
```

This will read your `pyproject.toml` file and install all the required dependencies.

## Managing Virtual Environments

Poetry creates and manages virtual environments for your projects automatically. To activate the virtual environment for your project, you can use the `shell` command:

```
$ poetry shell
```

This will activate the virtual environment and allow you to work within it. To deactivate the virtual environment, you can use the `exit` command.

## Running Scripts

You can define scripts in your `pyproject.toml` file and run them using the `run` command:

```
$ poetry run script-name
```

This will run the specified script within your project's virtual environment.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we covered the basic steps of working with Poetry to create and manage Python projects. Poetry provides an easy and efficient way of managing project dependencies and virtual environments, making it a valuable tool for any Python developer.
